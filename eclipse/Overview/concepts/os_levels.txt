    The operating system is divided into different levels with different
amounts of power over the system, and are identified by a two-letter prefix
describing the type of level, and a number identifying its level within that
type. Common levels are:

    LD - Bootstrap loader
        * Number usually identifies stage in bootstrapping
    KN - Kernel
    TR - (U)EFI transition loader
    US - User

    The kernel is also divided into multiple levels for drivers:
    
    KN0 - LTOS kernel
    KN1 - Hardware device driver
    KN2 - Service driver
